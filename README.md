# Pose Detector and AI Activity Tracker

This repository will:
1. Help you **get started** with beginner Machine Learning, sensor data collection, and pose estimation.
2. Provide examples of how to collect **accelerometer data** from a micro:bit and classify activities.
3. Demonstrate how to create a simple **pose estimation model** using your own webcam and Teachable Machine.
4. Provide instructions and images for both activity tracking and pose estimation.

# What do you need for this project?

* 1x micro:bit
* 1x micro:bit holder
* 1x micro:bit holder strap
* 1x Battery
* 1x USB-C Cable
* Access to a computer with internet access and a running camera

# Session 1: AI Activity Tracker

In this session, you will collect **micro:bit accelerometer data** and train a model using https://createai.microbit.org.

### Steps:

1. Prepare your micro:bit, battery, USB-C cable, and a computer with internet access.
2. Go to https://createai.microbit.org.
3. Follow the instructions in [`1-)AI-ActivityTracker/Instructions.txt`](./1-%29AI-ActivityTracker/Instructions.txt).
4. You will collect accelerometer data to classify:
    - Staying still
    - Walking
    - Exercising
5. Estimated duration for this activity: **15 minutes**.

# Session 2: Pose Detector

In this session, you will train a **pose estimation model** using your own webcam and https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com.

### Steps:

1. You only need a computer with a webcam and internet access.
2. Go to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com.
3. Follow the instructions in [`2-)PoseDetector/Instructions.txt`](./2-%29PoseDetector/Instructions.txt).
4. Train your model using your own images and **labeled movements**.
5. Test your trained model in real time.
6. Estimated duration for this activity: **30 minutes**.

# 3D Printable Micro:bit Holder

You can 3D print a **micro:bit holder** for the activity tracker.

- STL file: [`microbit_holder_3D-Print/IDEAS_MicroBit_Holder.stl`](./microbit_holder_3D-Print/IDEAS_MicroBit_Holder.stl)
- Citation file: [`microbit_holder_3D-Print/Citation.txt`](./microbit_holder_3D-Print/Citation.txt)

# Summary

Once you follow the two sessions in this project, you will have a complete experience of:

- Using the **micro:bit as an activity tracker** with an AI model
- Using **pose estimation** to classify movements from a webcam
- Applying Machine Learning in creative and physical computing projects
